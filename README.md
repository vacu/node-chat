### Install
* Run: npm install of npm install --no-bin-links for windows
* In views/layout.jade at line 12 change the address to your own (ex: io.connect('http://127.0.0.1'))
* In app.js replace GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID & GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET with your own

### Attention
  You cannot install socket.io on Windows through npm install!
  I recommend using a Linux VM is you are stuck with windows :>
